        <p>These <span class="cruel">cruel</span> companies, including Petco with their logo, Fruit Loops and Toucan Sam, and Pringles woth their logo.
             These companies have taken something very valuable from us, and this website will tell you the history of the tragic story of the logos of these three companies.

            <h2>Toucan Sam</h2>
            <h2>1963 - 2021</h2>
            <figcaption>Toucan Sam became the mascot for Froot Loops cereal in 1963. The cartoon character was created by Manuel R. Vega and originally voiced by Mel Blanc, using an ordinary American accent. Blanc's original commercials were noted for their use of Pig Latin (referring to the cereal as OOT-fray OOPS-lay). This poor Toucan will be missed, and you are encouraged to take a moment of silence for this bird.</figcaption>

            <h2>2009 - 2021</h2>
            <figcaption>Pringles' real identity is that he is a good-natured baker. When crafting the logo, some features were intentionally added to have a hidden meaning. For instance, the oval shape of the face in the early version was meant to resemble what the brand is, a potato chip. The pringles logo</figcaption>
